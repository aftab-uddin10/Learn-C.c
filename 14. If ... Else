// C supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

/*
.Less than: a < b
.Less than or equal to: a <= b
.Greater than: a > b
.Greater than or equal to: a >= b
.Equal to: a == b
.Not Equal to: a != b
*/

//Syntax

if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
}

//Example

int time = 22;
if (time < 10) {
  printf("Good morning.");
} else if (time < 20) {
  printf("Good day.");
} else {
  printf("Good evening.");
}
// Outputs "Good evening."


//Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)
//There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

//Syntax   (variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;)


//Example
int time = 20;
(time < 18) ? printf("Good day.") : printf("Good evening.");
